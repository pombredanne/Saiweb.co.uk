============

This is just the data for my blog at [Saiweb.co.uk][1] which I am in the process of converting to [Jekyll][2], using the information  posted by [paulstamatiou][3]
[1]: http://saiweb.co.uk/
[2]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll
[3]: http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll

Process flow is Wordpress --> Jekyll import --> Github --> Jekyll --> Static

This is currently a w.i.p
