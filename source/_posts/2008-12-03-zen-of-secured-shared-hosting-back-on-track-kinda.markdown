Well I have managed to plug the security hole, and I am currently working on refining the deployment by using the ability to disable functions in php ...

The downside?

Some 5244 approx functions over 23 a4 pages ...

For the impatient you can grab a php script I have written to build the complete comma separated list from subversion here: <a href="http://svn.saiweb.co.uk/branches/zen_of_secured_shared_hosting/trunk/disable_functions_string.php">http://svn.saiweb.co.uk/branches/zen_of_secured_shared_hosting/trunk/disable_functions_string.php
</a>

Please note this is a 'paranoid' list (some 354 functions!), you will need to for instance remove phpversion, ini_get and http_build_query from the list to get wordpress working.

Customize to your needs :-)
