I was reminded today on MSN that I had in fact written (albeit a long time ago) a class for querying the A2S protocol using PHP sockets.

So I have decided to release the source code for this under the MIT licence.

Bear in mind this was written when the Source SDK was leaked, so it is for PHP 4 (Which reaches "end of life" 08/08/2008 ). And I havent re-tested wheter it works in a LONG long long ... etc time.

However  With the exception of the addition of RCON functionality (which should of been put in originally Valve!), the A2S protocol has not changed

Anyway check the attached files, the licence is included at the top of the file.
