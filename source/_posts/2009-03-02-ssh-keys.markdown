I should of really written about this ages ago.

SSH Keys allow you to log into a server without the need for passwords by providing a public, private keypair for authentication, you can of course choose to specify a password for the authentication for an added level of security (Allowing you to have one unified login for you servers).

For the general user I would suggest the use of a password for securing the key further, you can forgo this in the case of secured automated processes however. (i.e. server to server backup via scp).


From the client machine:

<strong>Generate the key</strong>

{% highlight bash %}
ssh-keygen -t rsa
{% endhighlight %}

Follow the prompts to enter your password (or just hit enter for no password).

<strong>Copy the key</strong>

You must now copy the key to the server you wish to log in to.

{% highlight bash %}
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub target_user@target_server.com:~/.ssh/
{% endhighlight %}

Now log into the target server.

{% highlight bash %}
[target_user@target_server.com ~] cd ./.ssh/
[target_user@target_server.com .ssh] cat ./id_rsa.pub >> ./authorized_keys
{% endhighlight %}

Now exit the shell on the target server, and re-login.

{% highlight bash %}
ssh target_user@target_server.com
{% endhighlight %}

If you are prompted to enter a password this should be the password you entered when generating the key, if you did not specify a password you should now be logged into the target server without being prompted for a password.

This process works for both linux and MAC OSX, when generating keys as the client.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you regenerate the key for whatever reason this will replace the olde key pair, and you will need to go through the procedure of copying to the target server again.
