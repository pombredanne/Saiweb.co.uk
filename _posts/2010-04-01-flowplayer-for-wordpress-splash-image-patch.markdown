A user contributed patch from James Partington can be found <a href='http://www.saiweb.co.ukcdn.saiweb.co.uk/uploads/2010/04/Flowplayer-WP-patch.txt'>Here</a>

When applied you can specify a splash image to user and your media by seperating them with a "|"

/path/to/my/spash.jpg|/path/to/my/media.flv,300,150


This will be rolled into the next update, as soon as I can get some time to actually work on it!!

<strong>EDIT:</strong> despite the date of this post, no it's not a joke ;-)
