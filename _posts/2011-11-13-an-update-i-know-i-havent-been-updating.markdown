I know I haven't been updating a lot lately, esp on my poor blog (<a href="http://saiweb.co.uk/">http://saiweb.co.uk</a>), still I think I have things tied together enough to allow me to update once to everywhere (this post <em>should</em> appear on my blog, twitter, facebook, linkedin etc.

There's been a lot developing over the last few months, Openstack being one of my main focuses along with overhauling and provision new internal systems for Openstack to run upon, I have a plan so to speak ...

I have some Openstack posts coming I just need to ensure that all parties are happy with me posting the information "in the clear" so to speak.
