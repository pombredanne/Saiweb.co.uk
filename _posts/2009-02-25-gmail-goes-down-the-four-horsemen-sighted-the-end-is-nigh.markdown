Ok so maybe not, but by the reaction from the masses crying because Gmail has had a little outage, you would think the world was ending ...

google's official reply is that an update to their backup software has been causing interruption to service: <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/update-on-todays-gmail-outage.html">http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/update-on-todays-gmail-outage.html</a>

So all we can do is ride it out, and has others have said Google's uptime is still going to be better than most other mail solutions, _AND_ they are offering a 15day credit to anyone paying for the premium service ... AND this IS a BETA ...

So fair play to google, and I hope they sort the issues soon.

I mean WTF???) to paraphrase <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation">Yahtzee</a>, The only help they need is the help that requires taking them behind the garden shed and tearfully putting both barrels through their oblivious little faces ...
