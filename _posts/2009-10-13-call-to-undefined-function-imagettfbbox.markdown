<strong>Call to undefined function imagettfbbox()</strong>

Either you do not have php GD installed (check your phpinfo(); and see if GD has laoded with TTF support)

Or if you are compiling from source add: --with-gd  --with-freetype-dir=/lib64 --with-ttf=/lib64 --enable-gd-native-ttf

 to your configure line.

Note: you'll need gd-devel and freetype-devel libs installed, and im using /lib64 as im running a 64bit OS.
