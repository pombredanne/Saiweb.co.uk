Well the giant banner at the top of the blog can't of escaped your attention, and I still need your votes! so please check out the blog entry for <a href="http://www.saiweb.co.uk/general/vote-buzz-for-it-superhero-2008">IT Super Hero 2008</a>

For those awaiting the 'Build your own HD youtube' series completion, I have a dedi server en route, to allow completion of this series.

"Dell Core 330 v2 - Core2Duo E4600 (2x2.4GHz) 1GB RAM 160GB HDD"

CentOS 64bit, from what I have read the cpu uses Intels EMT, which is realy only about 48bits ... but neither here or there at the moment, this is coming from the guy's at <a href="http://www.ukfast.co.uk/">UkFast</a>.

So with the new dev server on the way the question is ... what do you want to see?

What tutorials / videos would you be of intrest to you?

Post a comment with suggestions, and just so you are aware comments are on moderation due to the couple of thousand spam comments posted every day :( ... so don't worry if your comment doesn't appear right away it's just waiting for me to review it.

Cheers

Buzz
