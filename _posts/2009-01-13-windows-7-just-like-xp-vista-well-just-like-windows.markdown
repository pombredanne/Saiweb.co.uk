So I decided to take Windows 7 for a spin in VMWare fusion, downloaded the shiny new 3.15GB x64 ISO and away I went ...

Only in typical windows style to have a flashing blue screen restart, in that you can see it B.S.O.D'ed (blue screen of death) but the system restarted so quickly it error message was utterly pointless and you'd need a high speed camera to see it ...

<strong>
UPDATE:</strong> Very obscure, but it has to do with the fact VMWare identifies the install as Vista x64, when it says the administrator password is optional DO NOT leave it blank, infact in this case it is not optional, setting a password allows the OS to install correctly it seems, I now have it running perfectly, you will also need to change the hard drive BUS emulation from SCSI to IDE.
