Due to the several hundred registered accounts in the last couple of days I have had a clean out.

And implemented the <a href="http://www.blaenkdenum.com/wp-recaptcha/">WP-reCaptcha</a> plugin to help reduce the amount of spam signups and comments.

So in short I am sorry if yours was a genuine account victim of the clean out, but you can sign back up and <a href="http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html">help digitize historic books in the process</a>.

The plugin also utilizes the Mail Hide functionality show here: <a href="mailto:d.busby@saiweb.co.uk">HIDDEN EMAIL</a> to help protect email addresses.

So now you can post your email address in comments safe from spam.

Cheers

<strong>UPDATE: There is an issue with .co.uk email addresses, I have contacted the plugin author, for the time being just be aware any hidden email addresses with show as domain.co so just add .uk on the end</strong>

<strong>UPDATE2: I have replaced the regex in the plugin with my own loose matching email regex, and the issue is now solved I have posted the code on the plugin page comments for the author, with any luck an update will soon be available.</strong>
