Or, as one of my colleagues this morning said, firmware programming which in the literal sense of the word I suppose it is firmware.

I've decided as some of my <a href="http://twitter.com/Saiweb">twitter</a> followers may already know to produce a library / framework for the <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html">teensy arduino</a> which is available from subversion here: <a href="http://svn.saiweb.co.uk/branches/teensy/trunk/">http://svn.saiweb.co.uk/branches/teensy/trunk/</a> under the GPL v3 license

At the time of writing I have worked through <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial2.html">this tutorial</a> on operating an RGB LED.

I've taken the examples an reworked them into a re-usable library incorporating a multitude of functions,

Being as I have all the parts to work through the full set of tutorials at pjrc, the library will be first updated to incorporate these examples, once complete I'll be heading over to the HID programming aspect, and there will be a library for a plethora of "fun" applications ;-)
