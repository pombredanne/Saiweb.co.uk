jQuery.saiweb is a plugin I am releasing under the creative commons license, it is more a tool set than anything else, that I will be adding additional functions to as / when I require them.

Version 0.1 has been released and brings two functions showhide() and typewriter(), more information can be found on the documentation pages starting here: <a href="http://www.saiweb.co.uk/jquerysaiweb">http://www.saiweb.co.uk/jquerysaiweb</a>
