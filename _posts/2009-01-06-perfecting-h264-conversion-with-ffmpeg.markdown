Liam (<a href="http://goodingsweb.com">http://goodingsweb.com</a>) has shared his findings on tweaking ffmpeg output with h.264, he has taken a 174MB flv file down to just 24MB (86% reduction in file size).

There is no noticeable difference in quality either, you can follow the forum thread here: <a href="http://flowplayer.org/forum/7/12671">http://flowplayer.org/forum/7/12671</a>.
