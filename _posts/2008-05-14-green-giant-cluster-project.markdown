So I am still looking for a viable PICO itx motherboard supplier ... but the concept is rolling along nicely, so here's a little more information.<br /><br />The "project" is to make a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_%28computing%29">beowulf cluster</a> but as efficent and therefor <font color="#006600">green</font> as possible, current "Pico" itx power suppliers advertise a 96% efficency ... not bad <br /><br /><b>So why the pico form factor?<br /><br /></b>The reason I am going for this form factor is due to it's size and power draw, because of the lower power draw of this form factor it allow for other (<font color="#009900">greener<font color="#000000">) power options to be explored.<br /><br /><b>So what's the spec?<br /><br /><br /></b>The project must have the following:<br /><br /></font></font><ol><li>Have at least 4ghz (4 nodes), distibuted processing power</li><li>Not draw more than a total 30w / GHZ under load (Bringing the 4 node total to just 120w)</li><li>Fit into a 2u rack chasis.</li></ol>The lower the power consumption per GHZ the better, obviously, and if I can reduce the power consumption under load enough, this should allow for offsetting the running of the cluster using alternative energy sources.<br /><br />Anway I have now created a category <a href="http://www.saiweb.co.uk/category/green-giant">green giant</a> and will continue to post more information as the concept progresses, I hope to get some technical diagrams up soon.<br /><br /><br />
