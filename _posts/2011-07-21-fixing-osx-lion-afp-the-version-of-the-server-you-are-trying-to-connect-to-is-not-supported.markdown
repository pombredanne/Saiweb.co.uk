For those using netatalk for AFP shares in this case I am using CentOS, the EL5 compiles are missing the configure lines for the dhx2 extension, which is required by OSX Lion, if you are running x86_64 you can grab this file: <a href='http://cdn.saiweb.co.uk/uploads/2011/07/netatalk-2.0.5-2.x86_64.rpm_.zip'>netatalk-2.0.5-2.x86_64.rpm</a> I have also emailed the Package maintainer @ EPEL with the changes I have made for this RPM so I would like to think that -2 will be available from EPEL soon.

Let me know if you have any issues with my RPM.
