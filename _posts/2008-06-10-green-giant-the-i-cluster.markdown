<p>So the 3g iPhone is out, and a _lot_ of 1st gen iPhone people are looking to grab this new phone as a replacement due to the new features, 3g, gps etc ...</p>
<p>That leaves a _LOT_ of 1st gen iPhones that potentially are going to end up on your local dump (landfill) ...</p>
<p>Further to the "Green Giant" beowulf cluster project, with the 1st gen iPhone having been cracked open for homebrew multiple times (<a href="http://www.hackaday.com/search/?q=iPhone">Hackaday search for Iphone</a>), why not try to re-cycle the 1st gen iPhones into this project as cluster nodes?</p>
<p>I am now looking at places like freecycle to see if I can get hold of any 1st gen's to do development on ... time will tell</p>
<p>But one of the features I have planned should I be able to get hold of a 1st gen or two is using the accelerometer to control the nodes online / offline status ...</p>
<p>Anyway all concept and dreams unless one appears.</p>
