The largest single donation will get my services in a technical aspect free for 24 hours, all proceeds go to red nose day (<strong>SO MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THAT GIFT AID BOX!</strong>).

This could be something along the lines of the following:

<ol>
	<li>Server Setup</li>
	<li>Solution Consultation</li>
	<li>PHP & mySQL development</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flowplayer.org">Flowplayer</a> development / deployment / help</li>
	<li>Technical support</li>
	<li>Anything vaguely Linux/Mac/Windows related</li>
	<li>Your own vid/screen cast tutorial</li>
</ol>

It's not quite something "funny" I know, but I hope you can send a donation EVEN if it's £1.

"<strong><em>In a nutshell, when you raise cash for Comic Relief, not only will you have a great time, you’ll also change someone’s life for good.

From helping a child growing up with domestic violence, a dad living with mental health problems or a lonely older person with dementia living down the road in the UK, to supporting orphans and desperately poor communities in Africa</em></strong>"
