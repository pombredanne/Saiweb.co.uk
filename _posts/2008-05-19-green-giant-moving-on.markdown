Today I have managed to find a bargain, and have ordered 4 x 1GB compact flash cards to run the nodes. (£3.96) I'm just having to negotiate postage at the moment ... as £4 per card is a bit excessive!<br /><br />So provided I can get combined postage current project cost is at £7.96 ... Now I need to find some pico / mini itx bargains.<br /><br />
