a very basic video tutorial covering how to compile with debug information, load your app into gdb, set breakpoints and step through it.

No where near as much details as I wanted, but I never seem to get time to finish the full version, this will help in the interim.

NOTE: you will need XviD codec or use VLC.

If you re-distribute the video please give a link back (don't force me to start water marking).
