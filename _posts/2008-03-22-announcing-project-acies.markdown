Acies Latin: a sharp edge or point; mental acuity, sharpness of vision

A fitting name I thought for my new project, rather a name of a framework (yes I actually intend to finish this one!), initially the framework will comprise of code I have written over the years (brought in-line with PHP5).

More details will appear @ <a href="http://acies.saiweb.co.uk/">http://acies.saiweb.co.uk</a> as I complete the modules.

There are several projects lined up awaiting completion of Acies, once in place I should be able to turn these around quite rapidly.

More Soon
