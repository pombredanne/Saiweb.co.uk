After updating to 2.7 I can confirm that Wordpress Flowplayer does not work with 2.7

Most likely due to hook changes.

I will be publishing an update shortly to correct this.

<strong>
</strong>

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: This was due to a folder permission problem post upgrade, remember to ensure your wp-content dir is at least 711 *doh* (Also bear with me on the stylings they also broke my theme :-( )

Also please note I am working on integrating flowplayer 3.0.1. into the plugin, as such do not update your plugin from the development respository at this time.
