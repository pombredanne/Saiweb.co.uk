Following on from deploying 802.1Q in prep for these VoIP phones, they have been delivered this morning *yey*, that said a nice error message

<code>
2/5 network setup</code>

bad tftp1 address

*meh* .. still not one to wait, so a quick google later reals by pressing "i" followed by "#" on the handset (before it resets), brings up a config menu ...

Expect more doubt as I continue to "play".
