Ok I purchased Jing PRO to do some more video posts to saiweb ... unfortunately the MP4 quality is lack luster. 

[FLOWPLAYER=http://www.saiweb.co.ukturbo.paulstamatiou.com/uploads/2009/01/jing_mp4_bad.mp4,300,179]

To be honest I'd rather have a large size MP4 I can run through my own encode (i.e. FFMPEG) and get the quality I want ...

Off goes the email to support ... wooo ....

NOTE: You may have to watch the vid in fullscreen to view it properly, I have scaled the player down to fit the blog page width.
