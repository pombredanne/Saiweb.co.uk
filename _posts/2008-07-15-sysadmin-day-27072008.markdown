<p>Or that would be 07/25/2008 for the US readers.</p>
<p>It is here again, the last friday of july is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Administrator_Appreciation_Day">System Administrator Appreciation Day</a></p>
<p>So get them a card / lifetimes supply of coffee / beer / LOTS AND LOTS of BEER</p>
<p>Or  you may find next time that file goes _missing_ there may be a delay in restoring it ;-)</p>
