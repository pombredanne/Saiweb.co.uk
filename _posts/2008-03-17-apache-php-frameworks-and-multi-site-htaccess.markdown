If like me you have a PHP framework, that runs multiple sites, you no doubt have thought at some point in time ...

<em> "Hey I realy could do with this re-write rule on that site, but I don't want it applying to all sites running on the same framework"</em>

Well fear not, after much head scratching, AccessFileName directive to the rescue! i.e.

 Using the above method you can specify bespoke htaccess files on a per VirtualHost basis.

{% highlight bash %}&lt;VirtualHost xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80&gt;
        DocumentRoot /path/to/framework
        ServerName buzz.saiweb.co.uk
        <strong>AccessFileName .buzz_htaccess</strong>
        CustomLog logs/buzz_access_log combined
        ErrorLog logs/buzz_error_log
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;{% endhighlight %}
 Enjoy!
