Ah yeh so I forgot to blog about this, 2.0.1.2 of my wordpress plugin is now available, as noted development of this plugin is unaffected by recent events.

2.0.1.3 will be released shortly to amend a minor bug with nonstandard wordpress installs, 2.0.1.2 fixed the loading in of flowplayer and the javascript libs however as Jerry has pointed out here: <a href="http://www.saiweb.co.uk/wordpress-flowplayer/comment-page-1#comment-995">http://www.saiweb.co.uk/wordpress-flowplayer/comment-page-1#comment-995</a> this does not extend to wp-content/videos/

As such for the time being as a work around please use the full http://yoursite.com/blog/wp-content/videos path when embedding media.
