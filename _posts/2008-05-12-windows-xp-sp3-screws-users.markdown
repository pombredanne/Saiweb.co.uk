<p>Oh dear oh dear, MS at it again.</p>
<p>Accoding to this story: <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/09/windows_xp_sp3_reboots_crashes/">here</a></p>
<p>SP3 has caused a huge rollout headache including screwing MS's Point Of Sale application ...</p>
<p>See now this is what happens when you FORCE users to have to install SP3 before they can get any more updates &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;</p>
<p>Admitedly the users experiancing the problems all using Automatic Update ...</p>
<p>So my advise is to grab the complete Network distribution (about 319mb).</p>
<p>Update if you are having problems and are using an AMD machine read this: <a href="http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/archive/2008/05/08/does-your-amd-based-computer-boot-after-installing-xp-sp3.aspx">here</a></p>
