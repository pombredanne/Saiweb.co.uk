<div style=''>So I finally got a response ...<br /><br /><br />"<i>Hello,<br /><br />Thanks for asking about shipping. All shipping and handling costs are per item and as advertised on eBay. <b>We don't negotiate on shipping at all</b>. Please refer to the shipping costs per item mentioned clearly at the bottom of all eBay item. Insurance per item is also not negotiable but is optional. Please note that shipping consists of various things such as packaging, handling, insurance, bar-coding, automation and 3rd party services from the Insurance co. and electronic postage processing with includes postage and automatic notification.</i>"<br /><br />Somehow I realy do not see that I am going to get <b>£16</b> worth of postage from £3.96 worth of items ...<br /><br />Beware the eBay small print, I am quite annoyed on this realy didn't expect this from a UK seller.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
