Most of the time when I review our log watches each morning I become enraged at the number of automated attacks,

But ever so occasional I find one that frankly intrigues me.

Today is just such an occasion where I have had multiple Brute force login attempts, the ingenious part is this attack has been designed to bypass tools such as fail2ban, blockhosts etc, and this is how
<ol>
	<li>Attack is launched from <strong></strong></li>
	<li><strong></strong> has PTR set for <strong></strong></li>
	<li>Failed login attempts record <strong></strong> due to reverse lookup</li>
	<li>There is no A record, attacker maintains their own nameservers for the <strong></strong></li>
	<li>fail2ban notes failed logins, attempts to resolve <strong></strong> to an IP but fails, due to missing A record</li>
	<li> Attacker can continue brute force attempts unhindered by being banned</li>
</ol>
I am still reading into how to counter this and will update this post as I figure out how to work around it, it's a very sneaky and frankly quiet clever method of working around most automated blacklisting/banning tools.

<strong>Update 1:</strong>
One method I am trialing is the "log target" feature of iptables, in an attempt to match login failure times to the iptables log, I'll post back with results.

[cc lang="bash"]
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ftp -j LOG
[/cc]

Outputs

<strong>Update 2: Defeating the hack</strong>

Now granted this would be a lot worse had the attacking IP been dynamic, fortunatly in this case it's not

[cc lang="bash"]
grep kernel /var/log/messages | awk '{print $9}' | sed 's/SRC=//' | uniq -c | sort
[/cc]

{% highlight bash %}
390   173.XXX.XXX.XXX
      4 195.XXX.XXX.XXX
{% endhighlight %}

Ip's have been masked to prevent anyone complaining or threatening legal action (again) for inferring you should block their ip / network range ... and me firing off the obligatory "Well if you policed your own network I wouldn't have to post this no would I" email, 

Maybe I am just being Cynical in my "old" age ...

Any how as you may have guess I'm black holing the ip with the 390 connection entries.

<strong>Thanks</strong>

Being as I spoke to a load of people during the course of this I realy can not remember who contributed what to this solution, so I'll just have to thank you all let me know if you want a crediting link.
