Blog updates very well may become few and far between over the next couple of weeks, whilst I literally hammer out some issues with the Joomla database structure breaking mySQL replication *sigh*.

Then there is the varios nagios addons I am writing for monitoring/alerting/gathering perf data for the solution (closed source atm sorry).

You can however follow me on twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/saiweb">http://twitter.com/saiweb</a> which I will try to update at least once a day.

The next *big* release planned is 2.0.1.0 of Wordpress-Flowplayer, the release will address Issue <a href="http://trac.saiweb.co.uk/saiweb/ticket/6">#6</a> meaning an overhaul of the current admin menu.

If you want to request a feature or report a bug with the plugin you can do so in our <a href="http://trac.saiweb.co.uk/saiweb/">TRAC</a> system, you do not even have to register anymore.

Cheers
