<p>So I have a concept for a 24 node cluster, I want to build to run folding@home and other cancer research projects</p><br /><p>The spec is to make it as "green" as possible, the lower the watts/ghz the better, whilst still maintinaing performance.</p><br /><p>The downside is the pricing of pico-ITX at the moment, I'm getting quotes for about Â£200 / node ... and that's without ram, or storage ...</p><br /><p>What I need is the following.</p><br /><p>pico-ITX form factor motherboard with ~1ghz CPU, in quantities of 5 or more</p><br /><p>So please leave a comment or use the contact me form if you think you can help, or have any information on suppliers.</p><p></p>
