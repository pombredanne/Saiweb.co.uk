<div style=''>"adimpleo" Latin for "to perform", seemed a fitting name for dbStat.

dbStat is currently being re-worked to include the use of <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/">rrdtool </a> among other features, "adimpleo" is to be geared towards providing an "under the hood" view of LAMP based web applications.

Expect screenshots soon.
