I was a bit taken back today after stumbling across this pdf by Dr. Wolf-Fritz Riekert <a href="http://share.ieservices.de/downloads/documents/Wordpress_Flowplayer_Plugin_pash-m_recent_version.pdf">http://share.ieservices.de/downloads/documents/Wordpress_Flowplayer_Plugin_pash-m_recent_version.pdf</a>

Google translated version</a>

Seems my plugin and the code therein has been the subject of a study, after perusing the google translation of the document I can see some very interesting concepts on how to improve the plugins integration with wordpress itself, I have sent an email Dr. Wolf-Fritz Riekert, asking if I can take his concepts and apply them to my code, so have a read and check back for version 2.1.0.0 soon, 

Also of note the authors at <a href="http://Flowplayer.org">Flowplayer.org</a> have also granted me permission to use the latest verison of flowplayer, this will be rolled into 2.1.0.0

Remember to request features please use my <a href="http://trac.saiweb.co.uk/saiweb/">Trac system</a>.

<strong>Update:</strong>Dr. Wolf-Fritz Riekert has gotten back to me, this study is in fact the work of a group of students, the project leader of which was Martin WÃ¶rz, of <a href="http://ieservices.de">ieservices.de</a>, I'll be liaising with him over the concepts in the study.
