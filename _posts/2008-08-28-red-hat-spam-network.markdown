In the last 24 hours I have received one email every 30-40 minutes from the red hat network alerting me to a "bug" fix ...

Each time to a different package ... so I have no idea as to why the sudden explosion of updates at the moment, either something was royally screwed in the last set of releases or somone slipping pro plus in the developers coffees.

I'm hoping it's the later.

UPDATE: Never good news is it? I was all for the developer hopped up on caffeine see this forum here:
