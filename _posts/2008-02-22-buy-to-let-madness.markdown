Working with a company that largely deals in property investment and information relating to it, has left me quite intrested in the whole buy to let market ...

Over at <a href="http://www.propertysecrets.net/blogs/under_the_hammer/hot_uk_buytolet_property_auction_tips_from_our_inhouse_expert/post-134.html" title="Property Auction Blog">Propertysecrets</a> (free registration required to view) Rob Best talks about property auctions, and the insane amount of profit some people are getting by finding properties being auctioned well below their market value.

Now to find some property auction data feeds, and write a daemon to automatically pick out the best BMV's (Below market value) for me ... well I can dream can't I ?

Sod it I'm going back for another coffee, if it's not spouting binary I'll never get my head around it :-P
