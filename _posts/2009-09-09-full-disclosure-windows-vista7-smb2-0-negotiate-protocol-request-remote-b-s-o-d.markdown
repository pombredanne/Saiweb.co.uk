<a href="http://g-laurent.blogspot.com/">laurent gaffie</a> has produced a proof of concept remote BSOD affecting windows vista /7.

It is advised at this time to block all NETBIOS and SMB trafic on your network as there is currently no patch available.

At the time of writing this entry I tested this on a Windows Vista VM (fully patched).
