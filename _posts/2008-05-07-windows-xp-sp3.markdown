<p>
<p>Well it's finally here!</p>
<p>
<p>And I get the fun task of testing this service pack and then rolling it out over a few hundered laptops located all over the place!</p>
<p>
<p>Oh well, I'm using my laptop as the test subject at the moment (poor thing), I'll post updates with any problems I run into along the way.</p>

<p>Well I realy do suggest you set aside a good hour per machine for this update (bare in mind I am using the Netoork rollout pack 316mb), especially if the client machine has windows live messenger installed, which seemed to need some sort of update entailing 30 minutes of wasted time.</p>
<p>If you have an antivirus running during the install it will take even longer.</p>
<p>
<p></p>
<p>Other than that _thusfar_ I have had no problems with SP3. Post a comment if you get stuck though.<br /><script type="text/javascript"><br/>src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"><br/></script></p>
