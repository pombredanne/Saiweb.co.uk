spambag.org domain appears to have not been renewed as such it is sat at a generic 'adverts' placeholder.

This does mean that RBL lookups against blacklist.spambag.org are returning as a 'false positive', (similar to the <a href="http://www.saiweb.co.uk/windows/blocked-by-ordb">ORDB</a> issue)

If you are concerned about being listed on some RBL's then get a copy of my sysadmin script <a href="http://www.saiweb.co.uk/sysadmin">here</a> at the time of writing the 'rblcheck' function checks 27 RBL's.
