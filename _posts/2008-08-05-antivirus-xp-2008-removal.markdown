Rarely has an adware / spyware given me cause to chuckle, this little sod sets the desktop background with a nice bright blue and yellow warning shouting "You have a virus" ... and places a desktop shortcut to the offending program Antivirus XP 2008.

On top of that in the case I am currently working on it has set the local machines GPO to hide the "Desktop" tab in the desktop properties.

The idea behind this is shock fraud, upon running the program it will tell you the computer is infected with thousands of malware and viruses, which wont show up on any other anti virus product, leaving you with supposedly one option ... to PAY for their software ...

Yeh like hell ...

Fortunately the guys over at <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com">bleepingcomputer.com</a> are on top of things, and provide removal instructions for this fraudulent software.

I'll be intrested to see if their removal tool resets the GPO.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Make sure after installing the malwarebytes' software that you first run an update before scanning.

As mentioned in the bleeping computer article, if your antvirus let this program in, in the first place it may be worth purchasing the pro version of Malwarebytes' to get the real time protection (NOTE: The freeware version will remove Antivirus XP 2008 regardless).

<strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Malwarebytes' removed Antivirus XP 2008, and restored the "display" tab, under desktop properties.
