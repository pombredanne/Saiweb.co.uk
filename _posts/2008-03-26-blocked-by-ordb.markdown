<p>Well this is a barrel of laughs...</p>
<p>"<em>The problem is that the ORDB blacklist (which was decommissioned on Dec 18 2006) has been reactivated, but in such a way that it returns a positive match for every query. The operators have done this in order to prompt people who were still using the list to remove it from their configuration.</em>"</p>

<p>At the moment this is effecting our exchange servers, and it's unclear if this is a legacy smtp event or part of the anti spam software...</p>
<p>Everything is being bounced, needless to say I can tell you working for a company that has over a million emails a day this is NOT GOOD!</p>
<p>If your clients are receiving bounce backs I suggest you contact them immediately, and inform them of the situation.</p>
<p>ORDB SORT YOUR ACT OUT!</p>
<p>I will update as I find a workaround!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE!!!!</strong></p>
