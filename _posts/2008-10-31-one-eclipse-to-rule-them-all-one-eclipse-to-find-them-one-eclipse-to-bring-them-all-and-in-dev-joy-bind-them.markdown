So ... LoTR was obviously on TV a few days ago ...<br /><br />Onto the point, at the moment I am maintaining 2 different installations of eclipse ... one for PHP, C++.<br /><br /><br />Wouldn't it be great if I could have both of these in one happy installation? ... Yeh it would however getting all the dependencies is an utter nightmare ... unless you have a program do it for you.<br /><br /><br />Long story short: http://ondemand.yoxos.com/geteclipse/start<br /><br />Customize your eclipse before you download it.<br /><br />(Thanks Austin!)<br />
