As I sit here tapping away on the iMAC currently in use whilst I wait on my Mac Book Pro, I am looking at various projects around the Google APS API ... One notably of which is the Google Docs, file sharing and collab system.

"MacFUSE implements a mechanism that makes it possible to implement a fully functional file system in a user-space program on Mac OS X (10.4 and above). It aims to be API-compliant with the FUSE (File-system in USErspace) mechanism that originated on Linux."

Not much to the end user, but basically will allow you (with some programming) to mount pretty much anything as a file system volume.

The techdemo video lists implementations such as docFS (Google Doc's API) and rssFS (rss feeds as a file system).

Looking at the hello world example on the macFuse wiki it should be fairly simple to implement pretty much anything as a file system.

More to come once the MBP arrives.
