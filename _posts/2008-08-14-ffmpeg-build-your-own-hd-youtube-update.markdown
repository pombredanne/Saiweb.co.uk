Well the intrest in this subject seems to be picking up!

I am currently researching two pass encoding using libx264 and libfaac to allow low bitrate (fast loading) HD streaming.

As I figure this out you can see the results here: <a href="http://www.saiweb.co.uk/linux/very-basic-c-gdb-tutorial">http://www.saiweb.co.uk/linux/very-basic-c-gdb-tutorial
</a>

The embeding is handeled using a wordpress plugin I have written, I will make this available shortly.

I will be getting part one "FFMPEG" installation up today regardless.
