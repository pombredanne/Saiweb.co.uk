I am in the process of contacting charitable organisations for project "sanctimonia".

The project is a wordpress plugin to aid publishers to allow their content subscribers to donate to registered charities.

I had a paypal link saying donate to me on the right of this site at one point .... but then I thought to myself why ... It would of gone on gadgets or caffeine products, why not let my readers donate to charities via my blog?

Currently I have contacted:

<a href="http://www.globalangels.org/">globalangels</a>Â <a href="http://www.nspcc.org.uk/">NSPCC</a> <a href="http://www.hopehouse.org.uk/">Hope House</a>

And am currently awaiting their reply.

Any suggestions or names of charities to add?

PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT!

Cheers
