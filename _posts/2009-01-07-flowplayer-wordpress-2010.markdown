Completion of the milestone listed here: <a href="http://trac.saiweb.co.uk/saiweb/milestone/wordpress-flowplayer%202.0.1.0">http://trac.saiweb.co.uk/saiweb/milestone/wordpress-flowplayer%202.0.1.0</a>

Means 2.0.1.0 has now been released, so go update and give it a run :-)

I have noticed that wordpress has a habit of setting incorrect file permissions on the config file after updating, if you also run into this issue let me know.
