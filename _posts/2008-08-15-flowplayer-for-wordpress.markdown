Whilst I wait for a reply here: <a href="http://community.flowplayer.org/node/1051">http://community.flowplayer.org/node/1051</a>

I am making version 0.1 of this plugin available.

<strong>Installation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Unzip wpfp</li>
	<li>Upload to /wp-content/plugins/</li>
</ul>
<strong>Usage</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Make a new directory in the root of wordpress called "videos"</li>
	<li>Upload streaming media (.flv, .mp4) to /videos/</li>
	<li>In the wordpress panel (/wp-admin/) under plugins activate "Flowplayer for Wordpress"</li>
	<li>Write a post and add the tag (see example: <a href="http://www.saiweb.co.uk/php/flowplayer-for-wordpress#comment-174">here</a>) *</li>
</ul>
* Where "media.flv" is your video file, 600 and 450 are the width and height to make the flash player in the page.
