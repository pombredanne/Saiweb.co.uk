For this quick video I spent about 30 minutes playing around with the exmaples provided with the processing SDK, you can get a copy from <a href="http://processing.org">processing.org</a><br /><br />[FLOWPLAYER=motion_tracking_demo.mp4,320,262]<br />
<strong>
UPDATE 14/02/09:</strong> I forgot to upload the source code for this, it is now available here: <a href="http://svn.saiweb.co.uk/branches/processing/Motion_Tracking/">http://svn.saiweb.co.uk/branches/processing/Motion_Tracking/</a>

{% highlight bash %}
svn co http://svn.saiweb.co.uk/branches/processing/Motion_Tracking/
