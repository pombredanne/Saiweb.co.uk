Oh dear oh dear ...

It would appear this morning easynet is have some major issues reporting a major network outage on their status page: <a href="http://support.uk.easynet.net/support_status.aspx">http://support.uk.easynet.net/support_status.aspx</a>

Looks to me like a piece of downed routing equipment, for me at least any traffic routing via 67.17.198.202 black holes and the connection dies horribly.

Some bad routing setup there ... 

67.17.198.202 is listed as being in Georgia Atlanta (33.7271 -84.5785) (source: <a href="http://www.maxmind.com/app/locate_ip">http://www.maxmind.com/app/locate_ip</a>).

When trying to access some .co.uk domains on known UK geo IP's, I am getting routed via a dead US link .... nice ...

Well, I wouldn't want a boring easy friday now would I?
