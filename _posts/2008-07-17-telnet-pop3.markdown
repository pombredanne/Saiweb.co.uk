To test a POP3 connection using telnet open a command window or shell terminal and type the following

<code>
telnet pop.domain.com 110
</code>

Where pop.domain.com is the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) or IP address of the server you wish to test.

110 also assumes default pop3 configuration.

You will be greeted with somthing similar to:

<code>
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK dovecot ready.
</code>

Now you need to authenticate

<code>
