"e000820e Library Error Invalid Request"

or

Final error: 0xe000820e - Library error - invalid request

This was a _fun_ problem this morning that greated me upon trying to get last nights backup tape ...

What it would turn out to be is that the "mail slot" on our tape library was open, in error seemingly this had opened prior to moving the tape into position.

Closing the mail slot resolved the issue, however clearing the "Attention" status is proving to be a pain
