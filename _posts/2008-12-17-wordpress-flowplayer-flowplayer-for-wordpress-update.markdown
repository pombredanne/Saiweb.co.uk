With the release of wordpress 2.7 and flowplayer 3.x I thought it was time to update the plugin.

A development copy as always can be obtained from:

{% highlight bash %}
svn co http://svn.saiweb.co.uk/branches/wordpress-flowplayer/trunk
{% endhighlight %}

However please remember that it is development and most like will not work.

Anyway enough talk here are some screen shots of upcoming version of the plugin (2.x).

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I have been in contact with the flowplayer development team, and can now confirm 2.x of this plugin will support both GPL and commercial versions.

I am adding a section to the admin menu to allow input of a license key, and a link at the bottom of the menu to allow you to purchase a commercial license.

Purchasing a commercial license helps to support the Flowplayer project and continue it's development, for a list of features in flowplayer 3.x see: <a href="http://flowplayer.org/documentation/index.html   ">http://flowplayer.org/documentation/index.html</a>

Certain features i.e. custom logo, will only work with a commercial license.

Please direct any requests for support on this plugin to our TRAC system: <a href="http://trac.saiweb.co.uk/saiweb">http://trac.saiweb.co.uk/saiweb</a>

<strong>UPDATE 2: </strong>V 2.x of this plugin should be release this evening.
