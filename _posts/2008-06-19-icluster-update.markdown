No joy so far, and despite my postings to the local freecycle groups my list postings have been rejected as being "too extravagant" ...

Ok so I can understand their reasoning with it being a request for 1st gen iPhones ... still dissapointing as the intention is in fact to recycle them into a working cluster ...

Ho hum ...
